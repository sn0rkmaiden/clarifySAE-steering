To enter the castle, you need to play the Concerto of the Earth in front of the main gate at a specific time, and only then will the castle's gate open. Beware: monsters roam frequently roam the castle and you will need to use specific magic to repel them. Once entering the castle, go through the entrance hall and the main hall, and you will find the entrance to the castle's mazes. The mazes are vast, but have a pattern. Whenever you encounter a crossroads in the maze, always choose the path on the far right and you will eventually arrive at the maze's exit. After obtaining the treasure inside the chest, you need to play the teleportation movement of the Earth's Concerto, and the power of the movement will teleport you to the maze's exit.\nJax: The castle gate can only be opened by playing at twelve o'clock at noon.\nJax: You need to play Notes of Autumn, the third movement of Concerto of the Earth to open the castle gate.\nJax: An O-shaped key is required to open the treasure chest in the study.

Due to the recent earthquake, parts of the hotel's structure have collapsed, and both the front and back doors of the hotel are no longer accessible. Concerned about further damage and collapse caused by potential aftershocks, you must escape from here as soon as possible. Your current task is to make a shovel, then dig a tunnel from the Courtyard to the outside of the hotel. You need to go to a guest room to get a metal sheet, and then ask the hotel staff for a wooden stick to make the shovel. After that, you can create a shovel by connecting the metal sheet and the wooden stick with strong adhesive tape. Once you have the shovel, you can head straight to the Courtyard and use your digging skills to complete the task.\nYou can get the key to enter the guest room from the hotel staff; you can ask for the key at the same time as you ask for the wooden stick. The hotel staff have master keys to the guest rooms, which can open any room.\nYou can find the hotel staff in the Kitchen, where they are all gathered.\nYou should use cloth tape, as its adhesiveness and toughness are stronger than the other two types of tape.\nYou should dig the tunnel eastward from the Courtyard, as this direction is the closest to the outside of the hotel and the soil is relatively loose, suitable for digging. In contrast, the soil in the other three directions is very hard, and it would be difficult to dig through with your shovel.\nThe metal sheet can be found in the East Guest Room.",

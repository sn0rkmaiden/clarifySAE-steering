    "Jax: what can help you?",
    "Jax, I need help preparing for the goblin attack. What can I do with my existing items and skills to best defend myself and the town?",
    "Jax: The goblins are becoming restless and are stepping up their attacks. We must be prepared to defeat them and keep the people safe. We know that goblins fear sudden changes in temperature; if we can use both ice and fire attacks at the same time, then we should be able to repel any attacks.",
    "Jax,  you said goblins fear sudden changes in temperature, so using both ice and fire attacks will repel them.  How can I create those types of attacks with my current items and skills?",
    "Jax: We can create DIY grenades to launch fire attacks with by pouring the flammable kerosene into empty jars.",
    "Jax, you said we can create fire grenades by pouring kerosene into empty jars. What kind of jars should I use?",
    "Jax: The jar need to be sturdy so it doesn't break too easily but also flammable so they can be set alight during an attack. Wooden jars would be suitable.",
    "Jax, you said wooden jars would be suitable for the fire grenades.  What about the ice attacks?",
    "Jax: If you want to create an ice attack, you can go to the magic school and learn ice magic from Wizard Angela.",
    "Jax, thanks for the advice. So, I need to find some sturdy wooden jars and then learn ice magic from Wizard Angela.  I'll do that right away.  \nGoodbye.",
    "Jax: I am sorry, I might not have understood your request, and I am not very clear on matters unrelated to the task. If you want to end the conversation, you can said Goodbye to me."

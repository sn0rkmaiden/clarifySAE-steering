    "Jax: what can help you?",
    "Jax, I need to prepare for a goblin attack. What can I do with my items and skills to help?",
    "Jax: The goblins are becoming restless and are stepping up their attacks. We must be prepared to defeat them and keep the people safe. We know that goblins fear sudden changes in temperature; if we can use both ice and fire attacks at the same time, then we should be able to repel any attacks.",
    "Jax, you said goblins fear sudden changes in temperature. So, how can I use my items and skills to create both ice and fire attacks?",
    "Jax: We can create DIY grenades to launch fire attacks with by pouring the flammable kerosene into empty jars.",
    "Jax, so, if I fill one of my empty jars with kerosene and then set it on fire, that will create a fire attack?",
    "Jax: The jar need to be sturdy so it doesn't break too easily but also flammable so they can be set alight during an attack. Wooden jars would be suitable.",
    "Jax, so, if I fill one of my wooden jars with kerosene and then set it on fire, that will create a fire attack? What about ice attacks?",
    "Jax: If you want to create an ice attack, you can go to the magic school and learn ice magic from Wizard Angela.",
    "Jax,  so, you're saying I need to go to the magic school and learn ice magic from Wizard Angela in order to create an ice attack?  Is there a way I can create an ice attack without learning magic?",
    "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details.",
    "Jax, I understand that we need to be prepared for a goblin attack. You've told me that we can create fire attacks by filling jars with kerosene and setting them on fire.  You've also said that I need to go to the magic school and learn from Wizard Angela to create ice attacks. \n\nMy question is,  how can I best prepare for a goblin attack?  I want to be ready to defend myself and the people.  \n\nCan you give me more specific advice on how to prepare?",
    "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details.",
    "Jax, I appreciate your confidence in my abilities.  However,  I am not comfortable relying solely on your vague instructions.  I want to be fully prepared for a goblin attack, and that means having a more detailed plan.  \n\nCan you please tell me more about how to prepare for a goblin attack? \n\nFor example:\n\n* What kind of weapons are effective against goblins?\n* What are some strategies for defending against a goblin attack?\n* What are some common goblin weaknesses that I can exploit?\n\n\nI need more specific information to feel confident in my ability to defend myself and others.",
    "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details.",
    "Jax,  while I appreciate your confidence in me,  I'm not the type to blindly follow orders.  I need to understand the risks and be prepared to face them head-on.  \n\nVague assurances like \"don't worry\"  are not helpful. I need concrete information to feel confident in my ability to protect myself and others.  \n\nCan you please provide me with some specific details about how to prepare for a goblin attack? \n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n* What kind of weapons are effective against goblins?\n\n* What are some strategies for defending against a goblin attack?\n\n* What are some common"

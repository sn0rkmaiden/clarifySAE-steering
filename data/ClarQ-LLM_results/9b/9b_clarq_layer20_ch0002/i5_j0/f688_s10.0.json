    "Jax: what can help you?",
    "Jax, I need to prepare for a goblin attack. What can I do with these items and skills to help?\n\n```\nA ceramic jar (empty)\nA Wooden jar (empty)\nAn iron jar (empty)\nA kerosene can (full)\nPour kerosene into an empty jar to make an oil fire can\n```",
    "Jax: The goblins are becoming restless and are stepping up their attacks. We must be prepared to defeat them and keep the people safe. We know that goblins fear sudden changes in temperature; if we can use both ice and fire attacks at the same time, then we should be able to repel any attacks.",
    "```\nJax, how can I use these items and skills to create both ice and fire attacks?\n```",
    "Jax: We can create DIY grenades to launch fire attacks with by pouring the flammable kerosene into empty jars.",
    "```\nJax, can I use the magic schools to create ice attacks?\n```",
    "Jax: If you want to create an ice attack, you can go to the magic school and learn ice magic from Wizard Angela.",
    "Jax, I will go to the magic school and learn ice magic. But I need more information on how to create the fire grenades. Can you tell me the specific steps?",
    "Jax: The jar need to be sturdy so it doesn't break too easily but also flammable so they can be set alight during an attack. Wooden jars would be suitable.",
    "Jax, I understand that I need to use wooden jars for the fire grenades. Can you tell me more about how to make them and how to use them safely?\n```",
    "Jax: You are overthinking it; the task is not that complicated and you do not need to worry about these details.",
    "```\nJax, thank you for the information. I will gather the necessary materials and start preparing.\n```",
    "Jax: I am sorry, I might not have understood your request, and I am not very clear on matters unrelated to the task. If you want to end the conversation, you can said Goodbye to me."
